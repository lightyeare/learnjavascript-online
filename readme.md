This is my implementation of the final project for learnjavascript.online by [Jad Joubran](https://jadjoubran.io/). FWIW, you can see my certificate of completion [here](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbfn5lnvx/image/authenticated/s--GQs4wBFL--/v1737489984/certificates/javascript/chadpeters-5418.pdf).

The course uses an online environment to complete the exercises and projects. To gain a little more experience I turned it into a standalone Javascript project using Vite. I used chart.js to do the charting, and Lit to help with Web Components. I did a little bit of refactoring some of the JS into seperate files. 

I deployed it as an App Service to Azure (you can read about it [here](https://chadpeters.dev/blog/deploy-nodejs-to-azure)), but Jad doesn't want us leaving it online pointed at his Firebase for some reason ðŸ˜‚. 

My day job is as a back end developer in the Microsoft stack. It was very beneficial to take the time to systematically learn Javascript. I was feeling a little lost looking at front end code. I had several opportunties to assist with some front end issue while completing the course. I wasn't so lost anymore ðŸŽ‰.
